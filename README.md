# PICKLE

## It's Python! No, it's Tcl!, Wait, what is it? It's a programming language!

Currently vaporware. The ideas behind the implementation are detailed in [this blog post series](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/blog/pickles.html) of mine.

There are three partial implementations here:

* C++ -- this branch
* Python -- `python_pm` branch
* Javascript -- `js_prototype` branch

all in varying degrees of incompleteness.
