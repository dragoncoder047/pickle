# PICKLE

## It's Python! No, it's Tcl!, Wait, what is it? It's a programming language!

Currently vaporware. The ideas behind the implementation are detailed in [this blog post series](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/blog/post/2023-02-23-pickles.html) of mine.

There are three partial implementations here:

* C++
* Python
* Javascript

all in varying degrees of incompleteness.

The javascript implementation can be accessed at https://dragoncoder047.github.io/pickle/.
